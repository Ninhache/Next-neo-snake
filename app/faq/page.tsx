            <AccordionTrigger>What is Neo-Snake ?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Neo-Snake is a speedrun game named after its creator,
              &quot;Neo&quot;, and symbolizes a new or revolutionary take on the
              classic Snake game. In Neo-Snake, players can create their own
              levels and share them with the community. The main objective is to
              complete these levels as quickly as possible. The term
              &quot;neo&quot;, meaning new, emphasizes that Neo-Snake aims to
              revolutionize the traditional gameplay experience. The game is
              currently in its beta phase.

              Yoo, here&apos;s a crazy question! First of all, it&apos;s only a
              beta; there&apos;s nothing to win. We haven&apos;t planned to
              create a competitive scene for the game yet, so let&apos;s wait
              until the beta ends for now.

              Firstly, we aim to enhance the editor as the user experience is
              currently lacking. Additionally, we plan to introduce more
              features to the game and improve the graphics.
