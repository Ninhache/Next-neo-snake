            <AccordionTrigger>What is Neo-Snake ?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Neo-Snake is a speedrun game named after its creator, "Neo", and
              symbolizes a new or revolutionary take on the classic Snake game.
              In Neo-Snake, players can create their own levels and share them
              with the community. The main objective is to complete these levels
              as quickly as possible. The term 'neo', meaning new, emphasizes
              that Neo-Snake aims to revolutionize the traditional gameplay
              experience. The game is currently in its beta phase.

              A "snake speedrun"? But where does this crazy idea come from?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              That's not that crazy, the team think the snake game is pretty
              boring, we just want to improve it ? ï¿½

              Speedrun means competition, do we gain something?

            <AccordionContent>
              Yoo, here's a crazy question! First of all, it's only a beta;
              there's nothing to win. We haven't planned to create a competitive
              scene for the game yet, so let's wait until the beta ends for now.

              Firstly, we aim to enhance the editor as the user experience is
              currently lacking. Additionally, we plan to introduce more
              features to the game and improve the graphics.
